\section{Based on Chapra Problem 8.3}
% Equation:
\begin{align*}
\begin{bmatrix}
 0 & -7 & 5\\
 0 & 4 & -7\\
 -4 & 3 & -7
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
~x_1~ \\ x_2 \\ x_3
\end{bmatrix}&=
\begin{bmatrix}
40 \\ -30 \\ 50 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

The calculated solutions for $x_i$ are:
\begin{align*}
x&=\begin{bmatrix}
  -18.8793\\
  -4.4828\\
  1.7241
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
The transpose and inverse of $A$ are:
\begin{align*}
A' &=
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & -4 \\
-7 & 4 & 3 \\
 5 & -7 & -7 \\
\end{bmatrix} &
\mbox{inv}(A) &= 
\begin{bmatrix}
 0.0603 & 0.2931 & -0.2500 \\
 -0.2414 & -0.1724 & -0.0000 \\
 -0.1379 & -0.2414 & -0.0000 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
The condition numbers of $A$ are: \\
%% present all four different condition numbers in a profesional looking way
1-norm: 13.4310 \\
2-norm: 7.0040 \\
Frobenius norm: 8.2214 \\
$\inf$-norm: 8.4483 \\
%% discuss meaning of condition numbers

The condition numbers each relate to the accuracy of the relevant calculations. The larger the condition number, the less precise the calculation. Moreover, by analysing the base 10 logarithm of each of the respective condition numbers, the relevant number of significant figures that should be included can be identified. This is based on the matrix norm that is calculated by the relevant Python function. Specifically, the relative error of the norm of the computed solution can be as large as the relative error of the norm of the coeffficients of the respective matrix, multiplied by the condition number. Essentially, these condition numbers allow us to determine the precision that the matrix holds and the format of the values we are outputting.

\section{Chapra Problem 8.10}
The matrix equation can be written as:
\begin{align*}
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos(30^o) & 0 & -\cos(60^o) & 0 & 0 & 0\\
\sin(30^o) & 0 & \sin(60^o) & 0 & 0 & 0\\
-\cos(30^o) & -1 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0\\
-\sin(30^o) & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0\\
0 & 1 & \cos(60^o) & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & -\sin(60^o) & 0 & 0 & -1\\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
~F_1~ \\ F_2 \\ F_3 \\ H_2 \\ V_2 \\ V_3
\end{bmatrix}&=
\begin{bmatrix}
F_{1,h} \\  F_{1,v} \\ F_{2,h} \\  F_{2,v} \\ F_{3,h} \\ F_{3,v} % can use F_{1,\mbox{h}} too
\end{bmatrix}

\section{Chapra Problem 8.16}
The scripts and plot are in the appendices.

\section{Parameter Sweep 1}
%% Discuss relationship between i and v
There was a linear relationship between the voltage drop between nodes 6 and 1 and the current from nodes 5 to 2. As the voltage drop increased, the current decreased correspondingly. This similarly corresponds to the electrical equations representing the underlying physics of the circuit, such as Ohm's Law, $V=IR$ where $V$ is change in electrical potential in volts, $I$ is current, and $R$ is resistance in Ohms. These equations can presumably be interpreted via their absolute values as voltage is often considered to be negative. Therefore, as the voltage increases, the current must also increase correspondingly if the resistance is staying the same. 

\section{Parameter Sweep 2}
%% Discuss relationship between i and R
The relationship between resistance between nodes 5 and 2 and the current from nodes 5 to 2 was found to be logarithmic. As resistance increased, current decreased in absolute value, although in a logarithmic as opposed to linear fashion. This similarly follows the relevant electrical formulas which dictate these values. 
%% Discuss relationahip between log10(cond) and R

The graph of the relationship between the resistance between nodes 5 and 2 and the condition number of the coefficient matrix was an interesting graph. The base 10 logarithm of the condition number was specifically represented which led to an interesting graph. There was an initial dip in the value of the condition number followed by a continuous increase of a concave down fashion. This graph seems to be the most unique and assuredly merits further investigation.

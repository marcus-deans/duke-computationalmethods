\section{Chapra 2.22}
The graph is smoother at the beginning of both curves with comparison to the end. This is due to the spacing of the data points (originating in the initial domain function). At the start, these data points are more dense and thus when the 'dots' of the data points are connected, they are so close together so as to appear as a smooth line. Near the end of both curves, the size of the  curvei s larger so the distance is increasing while the number of data points remains constant, so the density goes down for that interval. This lower density means that the 'dots' of the data points, when connected, create a perceptibly non-smooth line as they are too far apart. This problem would be rectified by increasing the number of points in the domain, either in general or over that specific area of the domain. 

\section{Chapra 3.9}
This graph demonstrates that the velocity increases when either heigh of width increases, or both. There is direct relationship between them. An increase in width for a fixed height seems to more significantly increase the velocity compared to an increase in height for a fixed width; this was determined due to the increased number of striated colour bands on the right side of the graph (corresponding to changes in height) compared to the left side of the graph (corresponding to change in width). Each comparison was made while holding the other type constant. Regardless, both were found to have significant effect on velocity with the velocity being maximized when both height and width were at their maximum values. Furthermore, it was observed that \textbf{both} affected velocity to a large extent, as opposed to one factor having a large effect and the other not coresponding to significant change in velocity. This overall makes sense considering the equation used to obtain this result.

Using a planar model:
\begin{align*}
\hat{OC}(c, T)&=\sum_ma_m\phi_m(c,T)=a_0(c^0T^0)+a_1(c^1)+a_2(T^1)
\end{align*}
the model coefficients and other required values are:

\section{Sinusoids}
%%% Discussion
The $A$ value represents the amplitude of the cosine function. The $A$ value of 2 results in a amplitude twice that of the function with a $A$ value of 1; in this case, the amplitude is precisely two. Conversely, a $A$ value $<1$ would result in a decreased amplitude. The $\omega$ value affects the period of graph by changing the horizontal extension/compression of the graph. As the $\omega$ value increases, the period will decrease as related by the equation $period = ((2\pi)/\omega)$. The $\phi$ value represents the phase shift, or horizontal translation, of the cosine function, thus shifting the function either in the $+x$ or $-x$ direction or ''left or right''. Notably, a positive $\phi$ value will result into a shift to the left, thus perceived as moving in the negative direction, unlike other function transformations.

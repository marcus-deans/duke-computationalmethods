\section{Introduction}
This program displays information gathered from physical experiments regarding the relationship between force and displacement in several beams. Moreover, the experience of creating this program is designed to enhance understanding of basic Python principles. Specifically relating to springs, a model was formed based on a first-order polynomial, intended to replicate the $F=-kx$ equation that represents the relationship between spring force and displacement.
Lessons learned include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item How to create, customize, and edit graphics in Python
  \item How to save graphics for usage elsewhere
  \item How to import Python resources into a \LaTeX~ report
\end{itemize}
\section{Data Obtained}
The three data sets from the experiments are presented in Table
\ref{DataTables}.

\section{Calculation Results}
A first-order polynomial fitting algorithm determined that 
the coefficients given in Table \ref{Coefs} 
produce the best-fit of the data to a straight line.

\section{Conclusions}
% Add your conclusions here
In conclusion, the previously measured values of displacement and the corresponding resultant force for three different beams was used to create graphical representations of the relationship for each beam. Calculations were performed in order to represent the relationship, with the graphical format providing a more accessible qualitative evaluation of the correlation between displacement and force for each beam.

Each beam appeared to, in effect, behave similarly to a spring, at least for small displacements as observed by the compliance with the graph. Beam 2 and Beam 3 were both found to have substantially higher deviation from the line of best fit compared to that of Beam 1. This may be attributable to the higher displacement that may have caused the beam to no longer act like a spring, thus no longer complying with the previously established line of best fit that held relatively true at lower displacements.
